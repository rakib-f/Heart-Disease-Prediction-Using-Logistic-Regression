# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
World Health Organization has estimated that four out of five cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks. The project aims to predict the overall risk of CVD using Logistic Regression.
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
